Title
Arctic in-situ observing data discovery, access, and visualization

Summary
Plan a data management infrastructure for data discovery and access of key Arctic data sets from Arctic research funded platforms for use by scientists and other end-users. 

OR 

Connecting Arctic in-situ observing datasets to existing infrastructure like PolarWatch - https://polarwatch.noaa.gov/about/

Key Arctic data: 

1. Distributed Biological Observatory: Dataset are long-term observatory data that is collection of biological and physical parameters from lower to higher trophics from campaigns in areas with high productivity. They have been maintaining 8 hotspot transect lines in Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas. https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/dbo/.
- Key DBO datasets are stored here: https://arcticdata.io/catalog/data <search phrase 'DBO'>
- There are also data from this long-term DBO data archive: https://data.eol.ucar.edu/dataset/dsproj?DBO

2. EcoFOCI: Ecosystem 
- Key datasets are her: https://www.ecofoci.noaa.gov/data-links
